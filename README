1. Why this is needed

We already have "sent" for making suckless presentations, so where's
our suckless typesetter?  We need to make documents easy, and not have
a 2 gigabyte program (LaTeX) do the work.

2. What the program does. 

Simply, it takes a markdown document, turns it into a troff file (or a
groff file if you're still in the shackles of the GNU utilities), and
uses troff to render the document.  Simple.  Your styling preferences
can be stored in another file, or they can just be at the start of the
file.

3. Why shouldn't I just write a troff document myself?

Joe Ossanna really did a good job making troff, and this is not intended
to bash on his work. But he made it back in the 70's, and quite frankly,
troff files are showing their age.  Markdown is a way better form of
writing documents, due to it being **very** intuitive.  There's no need
to read a manual on it. It just werks.
